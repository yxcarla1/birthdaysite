                dearest Ayla, <br> <br> Happy Birthday! Even though I'm not in New York cuddling you right now
                and showering you with kisses, hugs, and gifts, I hope you can call this a gift. You know, time really
                does pass by fast. I completely forgot about 9 months two days ago; it just seemed like a minute ago it 
                was 8 and you were viewing the Moon and Sun website on FaceTime with me. 
                
                I'm so glad I was able to come home and see you last weekend. I would've actually gone insane from 
                not seeing you if I didn't (I already went a bit insane).

            dearest Ayla, <br> <br> 
                Happy Birthday! I really like today's date, I think it describes you perfectly... Even though I'm not in New York cuddling you right now
            and showering you with kisses, hugs, and gifts, I hope you can call this a gift. You know, time really
            does pass by fast. I completely forgot about 9 months two days ago; it just seemed like a minute ago it 
            was 8 and you were viewing the Moon and Sun website on FaceTime with me. 
                <br><br>
                I'm so glad I was able to come home and see you last weekend. I would've actually gone insane from 
                not seeing you if I didn't (I already went a bit insane). I didn't even care how late it was at night,
                I was just so excited to see you, my love. And yes, I did mention that I forgot you are actually taller
                than me, so I was like, wait a second. But you are still my baby (even though you hate it when I call you
                names now). I was so excited when I gave you your Nee Doh and I thought you were absolutely adorable ripping
                off the wrapping paper and then your eyes just lit up after seeing it. I really liked surprising you when you were
                going to meet me, I thought it was the cutest thing.
                <br><br>
                I like your Puerto Rico videos, you say you look horrible in them but I think you look so educated and helpful and it's super
                adorable. More reason for your extraordinariness. I think my favorite part now of helping you is doing your website. I told you
                I can make websites. And I just really like how you do so many good things even when you claim you don't. You really do and I love
                that. You really are a moon lighting up the darkness, a positive on so much negative in the world. You do good, a lot of good, and
                I hope you see that in yourself. I do, crystal clear. Maybe you need glasses. Don't worry, I'll give mine to you.
                <br><br>
                So since you are 18 now I am technically not committing a crime anymore and of course you can't be reported anymore.
                I love you so much and now my new reasoning is I love you more because I have 7 months of extra growing over you, so in
                conclusion, I'm fatter than you and smarter than you, and my heart is also bigger than yours (because of my heart condition too),
                so I actually love you more. 
                
                <br><br>

                I hope you have a lovely birthday and I hope you like my gift. Here's to being an adult now, but you're still my baby, mon amour.
                <br><br>
                Je t'aime plus,
                <br>Carls
